#Blood Donar Aleret
A AI ASSITENCE USED FOR FARMERS
### 1. **Front-End (What users see and use)**
* Use **Flutter** or **Android Studio (Kotlin)** to build a mobile app.
* Create screens for:

  * Home screen making of interface
  * Crop input form (for user to enter soil type, weather info, etc.)
  * Recommended crop results
  * Weather information
  * Fertilizer and pest advice
  * Language selection (English + one regional language)
* Keep the UI very simple and easy for farmers to understand.

---

### 2. **Back-End (How the app works behind the scenes)**

* Use **Python with Flask** or **Node.js with Express** to build the backend.
* Handle logic for:

  * Crop recommendation (based on input like soil and weather)
  * Fertilizer and pest suggestions
  * Multilingual text (you can use static translation files)
* Optional: Add a simple AI/ML model using Python (like with `scikit-learn`) to make crop predictions.

---

### 3. **APIs (Getting data from outside services)**

* Use **OpenWeatherMap API** to get real-time weather updates based on location.
* You can use mock or static soil data (no need for soil API unless you want real-time soil info).
* If you're not doing multilingual support manually, you can use a translation API (like Google Translate), but it's better to use pre-written translations.

---

### 4. **Database (Saving and reading data)**

* Use **Firebase Firestore** to store:

  * Crop information
  * Fertilizer and pest data
  * User inputs or preferences (if needed)
* Or use local storage like **SQLite** if you want the app to work offline.

---

### 5. **Deployment (Running the app for others to use)**

* Generate an **APK** file from Android Studio or Flutter to install on phones.
* If you're using a backend server (Flask or Node), you can deploy it using:

  * **Render.com**
  * **Railway.app**
  * **Heroku** (if still available)
* Host any web version or static files using **Firebase Hosting**, **Vercel**, or **Netlify**.
* Upload your code to **GitHub** with a proper README file.
* (Optional) Record a **demo video** showing how your app works and upload it to YouTube or Google Drive.

## ðŸ’¡ Tools Use: design and template  using sensors for to detect the ph of water and soil

* **VS Code** or **Android Studio** â€“ for coding
* **Postman** â€“ to test APIs
* **Git & GitHub** â€“ to manage and share your code
* **Google Colab** â€“ to build and test machine learning models
